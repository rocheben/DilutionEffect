This package is built with a clear set of design principles based on current
best practices. These design principles have been established before writing any
code to make sure obstacles along the way would not lower our expectations.

## Scope

## Naming conventions

## Transparent parallelisation

We believe that users should be able to decide *if* and *how* the functions
provided in this package should run in parallel.

This is made easy by the [future framework](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future) 
([introduction video](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/future-simple-async-parallel-amp-distributed-processing-in-r-whats-next-henrik-bengtsson)).

Similarly, the option to add a progress bar is left to the user by relying on 
the [progressr package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=progressr).
